# Contribution Guidelines - v1

## General
+ [Tabs over Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI)
+ When naming a variable that mixes two words, follow this ruleset:
	+ lowercase first Uppercase second.
	+ Don't use dashes, use underscores
	+ Make it short and simple (instead of `toggler_Button_2` do `toggle_B2`)
+ `ast` means Assets, `src` means Source and so on.


## Markdown
+ When writing Markdown lists, use the `+` symbol over the `-` symbol.
+ H1 is for Titles, H2 for Sections, H3 is for sub-sections and the rest are for warnings and such.

## HTML (and Markdown sometimes)
+ Instead of doing long codeblocks for one tag, do a one-liner (like this`<title>Hello World!</title>`).

## Git
+ Please add config/env files to the `.gitignore`, Thanks for your understanding.
+ If your commit title is vague, please try to expand it on the "comments" section.
+ When opening a Pull Request, explain to detail what your commits do, not everyone has time to look DIFFs at full-detail y'know.
